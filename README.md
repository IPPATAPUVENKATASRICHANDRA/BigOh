## What is Big Oh! Project? 🤔

**Big Oh!** is a groundbreaking tool designed to unlock the hidden insights of your code. Upload one or multiple code files, and watch as Big Oh! creates a **dynamic knowledge graph** that represents every package, function, and module as a **node**. This visual breakdown makes it easy to understand the complexity of your code and spot opportunities for optimization.

## How is it Useful? 💡

Imagine having a **smart assistant** that dissects your project into its essential components and reveals how they interconnect. **Big Oh!** helps you to:

- **Visualize** your code structure with clarity.
- **Identify** bottlenecks and complexity hotspots.
- **Optimize** and refactor with confidence.
- **Generate** detailed reports for better collaboration.

It’s like having a **code whisperer** guiding you through your project! 😎

## Who Can Use It? 👩‍💻👨‍💻

- **Individual Developers:** Enhance your coding practice with detailed visual analysis.
- **Development Teams:** Streamline collaboration with clear, shareable reports.
- **Code Reviewers & Architects:** Dive deep into your project’s architecture.
- **Students & Educators:** Demystify complex code structures and learn best practices.
